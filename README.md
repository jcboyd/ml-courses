Teaching materials on a few machine learning topics developed for TA work during my PhD.

## Deep learning

`deep_learning.ipynb` compares linear models and a simple CNN trained as image classifiers. It is separately available [here](https://github.com/jcboyd/deep-learning-workshop), along with links for optional cpu/gpu Docker images containing the material. I gave this as lecture and workshop material at:

* Institut U900 Unit retreat, Forges-les-Eaux (May, 2017)
* Introduction to Bioinformatics and Genomics with a new branch for cell data at PSL (Oct, 2017)
* [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/MA-2823-Foundations-of-Machine-Learning-%28Fall-2017%29) at CentraleSupélec (Dec, 2017)
* Génomique et Bioinformatique: Une Introduction at PSL (Nov, 2018)
* Génomique et Bioinformatique: Une Introduction at PSL (Nov, 2019)

## Principal Components Analysis

`principal_components_analysis.ipynb` presents some use cases for PCA on various datasets

* Given as workshop 1 in [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/MA-2823-Foundations-of-Machine-Learning-%28Fall-2017%29) at CentraleSupélec (Sep, 2017)

## Convex optimisation

`convex_optimization.ipynb` presents some convex optimisation basics in Python on linear and quadratic programming problems.

* Given as workshop 2 in [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/MA-2823-Foundations-of-Machine-Learning-%28Fall-2017%29) at CentraleSupélec (Sep, 2017)

## Support vector machines

`support_vector_machines.ipynb` presents the fundamentals of SVMs, both through sklearn and a full implementation from scratch of the SMO algorithm.

* Given as workshop 8 in [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://cazencott.info/index.php/pages/MA-2823-Foundations-of-Machine-Learning-%28Fall-2017%29) at CentraleSupélec (Nov, 2017)

## Stochastic gradient descent

`stochastic_gradient_descent.ipynb` compares gradient descent approaches for linear and logistic regression models

* [Large-Scale Machine Learning and Data Mining](http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~jvert/svn/lsml/lsml18/) at MINES ParisTech (Mar, 2018)
* [Deep Learning For Image Analysis](https://github.com/ThomasWalter/DeepLearningForImageAnalysis) at MINES ParisTech (Nov, 2018)
